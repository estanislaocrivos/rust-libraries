# Rust Libraries ðŸ¦€

This repository is a collection of useful Rust libraries created by me.

## Adding libraries

To add a new library crate to the project, run the following command:

```bash
cargo new --lib <library_name>
```

## Testing the libraries

Unit tests are expected to be located inside the `src/lib.rs` file of each library crate. Integration tests can be placed in the `tests` directory at the root of each library crate.
